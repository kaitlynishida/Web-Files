    <h1>Gymnastics Encyclopedia Page</h1>
    <p>Gymnastics is a very subjective sport in which gymnasts are scored by a pannel of judges and, ultimately, a committee of judges who determine the value of skills. For example, the way a routine is scored in elite and olympic gymnastics is in two parts and as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Each routine has a start value which is the sum of the value of each skill the gymnast will be attempting.</li>
      <li>The score also contains an "execution" score, which is where the judges determine how well the gymnast executed their routine out of 10 points.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Why Gymnastics Can Be So Controversial</h2>
    <p>This new system of scoring has not been around for long, and was <a href="https://usagym.org/pages/events/pages/fig_scoring.html">adopted in 2006</a>. Most people would recognize the old 10-point scoring system where gymnasts were scored solely based on their execution of the routine. This new scoring system gives credit to gymnasts for attempting more difficult skills, but it also can hurt gymnasts when the committee of judges does not properly score difficult skills.</p>
    <p>One gymnast in particular who has suffered from unfair scoring with this new system is Simone Biles. As many people may know, she is an incredibly talented gymnast with 7 Olympic medals and has won 5 world championships. In recent years, she has attempted to be the first to compete certain skills in order for them to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_elements_named_after_Simone_Biles">named after her</a>. Before competing the skills, the committee of judges determines their value, which was much less than Simone and her coaches were expecting. The reason this is frustrating for simone is because her skills are much more difficult to perform, and judges purposely scored them lower to deter other gymnasts from attempting them and possibly getting injured. Because the value of the skills is lower than it should be, it prevents Simone from performing those skills in competition becuase she would likely score higher in terms of execution on easier skills, thus making the more difficult skills not worth competing.</p>
