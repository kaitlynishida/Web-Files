    <h2>Student at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Kaitlyn Ishida and I am currently a junior at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing. Additionally, I am currently in the process of completing a minor in Creative Technology & Design, and a certificate in Global Business. I plan on graduating in the Fall of 2022.</p>
      <p>I am a member of the Diverse Scholars Program and Multicultural Business Students Association at Leeds, and I also participate in an all-female club called Women In Business. <p>
      <p>When I am not at school, I mostly enjoy spending time with my friends and family. Growing up in Colorado, I have always loved the outdoors and spend summers taking hikes! Some of my interests include sports, fashion, and design, and although I am not pursuing it as an emphasis I am also very interested in Real Estate.</p>
