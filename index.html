    <h3>My goals for this course!</h3>
      <p>One of my main goals for this course is to become comfortable enough with html and web design to hopefully be able to apply it to anything I do in the future! I had previously taken an html course my freshman year of high school that I really enjoyed, but that was years ago and I don't remember a thing! As a business student, I would like to be able to use the skills I gain for this course to hopefully make my own personal website in order to showcase my portfolio! I am really excited to be taking this course and I look forward to meeting new people who share the same interests as me!</p>
